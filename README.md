Scenario:1
Your task is to create a CRM system that allows a business to track multiple payment types:
One-Time Payments
Recurring Payments (Subscriptions)
Payment Plans (2x or 3x Installments)
This CRM structure will monitor the status of payments, ensure easy tracking, and allow the team to respond promptly if any issues arise (e.g., failed payments). Payment processing will happen via Stripe or PayPal through a ClickFunnels funnel, and the CRM should reflect all relevant data.

Exercise Instructions:
Create the CRM Structure:
Use Airtable or Monday.com to build a table or board that organizes the following data:
Customer Name
Product Type: One-Time Payment, Recurring Payment, or Payment Plan
Payment Status: Paid, Failed, Pending
Payment Method: Stripe or PayPal
Payment Date: (or Dates for Payment Plans)
Funnel Used: Which funnel (e.g., product landing page) the purchase originated from
Next Payment Due Date (for subscriptions and installment plans)
Customer Contact Information
Assigned Sales Representative (if applicable)
Payment Tracking System:
Build three separate views or dashboards to:
Track one-time payments and ensure each customer is marked as paid.
Monitor subscriptions, ensuring recurring payments are happening on schedule.
Track installment payment plans (2x and 3x) and highlight any missed or upcoming payments.
Payment Automation Plan (Optional):
Provide a brief proposal for automating payment updates via Make.com or Zapier.
Example: If a payment is marked successful in Stripe or PayPal, it updates the status to Paid in the CRM. If a payment fails, send a Slack notification to the finance team.
